# Applied-Statistics
ðŸ“˜ About
This project was completed as part of the Applied Statistical Methods for Biomedical Informatics (B518) course. In this class, I learned to apply statistical concepts using R to analyze and interpret biomedical data. Topics included probability, hypothesis testing, regression models, and survival analysis.

Our final group project focused on identifying key predictors of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using a real-world dataset. We used statistical tests such as Mann-Whitney U, Chi-Square, Logistic Regression, and Spearman Correlation to evaluate variable significance. Visualization tools like ggplot2, correlation heatmaps, and violin plots were used to support data-driven insights.
