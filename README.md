# Applied-Statistics
I learned how to apply statistical methods in biomedical informatics using R. I worked on real-world data analysis, including probability, inference, and regression. For our final project, we used statistical modeling and machine learning to identify key predictors of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, using tools like R, ggplot2, and logistic regression.
